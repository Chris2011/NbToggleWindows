OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    You can hit CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + ENTER to toggle opened windows. \
    If you hit it again, you bring them back.\n\n\
    ATM it works not very well with each case but if you have docked windows like projects and files and the navigator (For example), it works.\n\n\
    You have to be careful if you close netbeans and you hide all windows, I only save the windows inside a Set<TopComponents>. \
    So after closing netbeans all hidden windows are still hidden. \
    So make sure, that you show all toggled windows before you close netbeans.
OpenIDE-Module-Name=NbToggleWindows
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Toggle your open/displayed windows with a shortcut in netbeans.
